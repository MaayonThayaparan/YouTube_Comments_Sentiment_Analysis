  index.html — App Shell (Vite entry)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PURPOSE
    Minimal HTML shell for the React SPA. Vite uses this file as the single
    entry point during dev and injects the built assets in production.

  KEY DECISIONS
    - Preconnect to Google Fonts domains to reduce TLS/DNS latency for Inter.
    - Load Inter weights 300/400/600/700 once, globally (keeps bundle slim).
    - Theme is class-driven: `dark:` variants are toggled by the `dark` class
      on <html> or <body> (Tailwind). We keep the shell neutral, styling lives
      in the app CSS/Tailwind utilities.
    - Single mount node (#root); no server-side templating here.

  COLLABORATION NOTES
    - If you add additional webfonts or analytics, prefer <link rel="preconnect">
      for their origins, and keep scripts `type="module"` when possible.
    - Avoid inline styles/scripts for CSP hygiene; configure CSP in the server
      if deploying to stricter environments.

      PERFORMANCE: Font loading
      - Preconnect warms up TLS to Google Fonts endpoints.
      - `crossorigin` is required on the gstatic preconnect per Google guidance.
    -->
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>

    <!--
      Inter font family
      - Chosen as the primary UI face (also set in tailwind.config).
      - Weights: 300/400/600/700 to cover body, semibold labels, and headings.
      - Display strategy defaults to `swap` for minimal FOIT per Google API.

  </head>

  <!--
    BODY CLASSES
      - `page-bg` is a project-level class (defined in app CSS) that hooks
        into CSS variables (e.g., --surface) to provide themeable backgrounds.
      - `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100` sets a sane default foreground color
        that flips in dark mode; components can override locally.
  -->
  <body class="page-bg text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
    <!--
      React mount point: the SPA renders here from src/main.tsx.
      Keep this element empty; hydration/bootstrapping is handled by Vite/React.
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!--
      ENTRY SCRIPT
        - Vite resolves this ESM entry in dev (HMR enabled).
        - In production, Vite rewrites this to built assets in dist/.
        - Keep as `type="module"`; avoid legacy script loaders unless required.
    -->
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
